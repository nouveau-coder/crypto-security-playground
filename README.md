# Crypto Security Playground

## Project Description
This repository is a hands-on exploration of cryptography and foundational cybersecurity concepts implemented in Python.

The project focuses on cryptographic primitives, common misuse patterns, and attack techniques, with an emphasis on understanding how and why security mechanisms fail.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This project is intended strictly for educational and research purposes. It is not a production-ready cryptographic library.

**DO NOT** use real secrets, credentials, or sensitive data with any code in this repository.

## Planned Structure Overview
1. Cryptographic primitives
2. Attack simulations
3. Command-line tooling
4. Experiments and demonstrations
